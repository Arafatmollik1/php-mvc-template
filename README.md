## Basic mvc template for php
This is a basic php mvc template you can use to build basic mvc application.

## Prerequisites
- PHP, Composer
- Apache server such as Mamp or Xamp
- Mysql

## Install 
Download the codebase or git clone.

Check your root directory from htaccess and config.php
Currently "php-mvc-template" is the basename of the project. 

After download do

`composer install`

Then put the codebase to you root folder.
For instance if you are using mamp then your folder should be in

`/Application/MAMP/htdocs/`

Then change the configuration according to you project name or root folder name in config.php and htaccess.
Note that there is no .env file so include that into you root directory and add the varibales you can find from config.
Here is a sample .env file
`IS_PRODUCTION = no
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=just_testing
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
SESSION_PASSWORD = fdaimoaido1231ads`

Make sure to have the following coloumns in table called sessions in your database. 
 - hash
 - session_data
 - session_id
 - session_expire
   
You can also make the table with this query
`CREATE TABLE sessions (
    hash VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL,
    session_data TEXT NOT NULL,
    session_id VARCHAR(255),
    session_expire INT(11) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (session_id),
    KEY session_expire (session_expire)
);`

Now you are ready to run the project. 

## Features
1. **Config file.** In config.php you can define some of your configurations. You can then use it from global $config anywhere in the codebase.

6. To make a new view just put your frontend files into /frontend/[your page name]/index.php
7. You must make controller by the same name in controller folder
8. Wheatever you define in the controller then all the properties can be accessed in the frontend via `$serverData`

And in the controller file just do `somethingmoreAction` meaning add Action word at the end of the text and define that a function. and now you have an action inside the controller.
